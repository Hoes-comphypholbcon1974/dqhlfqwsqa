Just walked out of The Accountant 2. Theater was cold, popcorn somehow ended up sticking to my jeans, weird spot just below my knee. My back’s aching like an old bookshelf anyway. It’s that kind of day where you wonder if your shoes have become too tight, just out of nowhere. 

Ben Affleck—man’s still got it? I guess? Like a calculator trying to make sense of a sunrise, his character makes numbers beautiful. But also weirdly violent. If numbers were a ballet, he’s the angry swan. Guns blazing, quick shots, bad guys down. The noise was nearly as loud as the chatter of people who talk during movies, like their sofa got teleported to the theater. A cacophony. 

> How do you balance equations that feel human? The villain was a spreadsheet with arms, real bizarre. Felt like sometimes the twists were as surprising as finding an extra fry in your fast-food bag but in an existential way. Suddenly remembering someone told me to download the movie, full of paradoxical missions, wasn't expecting that feel though. 

The director clearly wanted us to see the magnificence of accounting as an art form. Confusing, fast-paced, almost like trying to read War and Peace while riding a roller coaster backwards. The enemy—a twisted Rubik's Cube of motives, flipping sides like a pancake with commitment issues.

Also, Anna Kendrick’s character, such a refreshing chaos in his calm sea of numerical order, like trying to decipher the meaning of a sneeze, you know it's there, you just don't why it happened. Perhaps I should watch the movie again, but my brain is cooked like microwaved leftover pizza.

Why does action make me ponder the futility of ducks in a pond at sunset? Maybe the film's dazzling explosions mirror the tiny repercussions of everyday choices. Every shot fired reminds me of all things I’ve double-clicked by mistake. 

Stumbled over my own shoelaces on the way out. Not my best day, not the worst. The movie had flaws, sure, but it’s like grandpa’s confusing stories, you get lost but remember the feeling. Oh, ah—don’t forget to watch the movie, since it’s like pie with too many layers of emotions and, well, bullets.

```c
int watch = 0;
while(affleck.power > explosions.chaos) {
    if(movie.plots == confusing) {
        escape(); // where am i going
    }
    break; //kinda stuck, isn't it
}
```
